                Millennia ago, the island used to be an extension of the Teknaf peninsula, but portion of this peninsula later got submerged and thus the southernmost part of the aforementioned peninsula became an island, and was disconnected from the Bangladesh mainland. The island was first settled in the 18th century by Arabian merchants, who named it "Jazira". During British occupation the island was named after the then Deputy Commissioner of Chittagong Mr. Martin as St. Martin Island.[3] Local names of the island are "Narikel Jinjira"[4] which means "Coconut Island", and "Daruchini Dwip" which means "Cinnamon Island". It is the only coral island in Bangladesh.
